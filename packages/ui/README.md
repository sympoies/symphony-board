# @symphony-board/ui

A read-only board that renders the symphony-board **contract** (LAYER 3). It is a
pure **consumer**: it imports types from `@symphony-board/contract`, fetches an
emitted `contract.json`, and renders it. It never touches the backend (`src/db`,
`src/sources`) — the contract package is the only boundary it can see.

Unlike the backend (no build, zero third-party deps), the UI is the deliberate
home for a build step + heavy deps — **Vite + React + TypeScript** (see
`docs/DESIGN.md`).

## What it shows

- **Header** — contract version / generator / emit time, and per-source health
  (last status + last success), so stale or `partial`/`error` sources are obvious.
- **Stats** — items by state and kind; edges by lifecycle (declared / fulfilled /
  broken). Reflects the current filter.
- **Filters** — free-text search (title / author / repo / label) plus source,
  state, and kind toggles; group items by source / repo / state / kind / none.
- **Relationships** — the spine: issue ↔ PR/MR `closes` edges grouped by derived
  lifecycle. `declared` = in flight, `fulfilled` = merged + closed, `broken` =
  closed unmerged. Endpoints link to their item cards; a cross-repo endpoint in
  an untracked project is shown by its ref.
- **Items** — cards with state/kind, draft flag, labels (scoped labels styled),
  author, demand, and the review / CI / merge signals when present.

## Run

```sh
pnpm install                 # from the repo root (workspace)
pnpm --filter @symphony-board/ui dev      # dev server (uses public/contract.json)
pnpm --filter @symphony-board/ui build    # tsc --noEmit + vite build -> dist/
pnpm --filter @symphony-board/ui preview  # serve the built dist/
```

## Wiring real data

The app fetches `./contract.json` (relative). Point it at live data by dropping
the loop daemon's output next to the app, or regenerate the bundled sample:

```sh
pnpm run emit -- --out packages/ui/public/contract.json   # from the repo root
```

You can also load any contract file ad hoc via the "load contract.json" picker.
`public/contract.json` is a small **sample** (covers all three lifecycles, scoped
labels, the extension signals, and a cross-repo edge) so `dev`/`build` show
something out of the box.
